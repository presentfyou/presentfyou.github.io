# HTTP/2 Transport

HTTP/2 transport is added in V2Ray 3.17. It is based on standard HTTP/2, and can be proxies through other HTTP server, such as Nginx.

Due to HTTP/2 recommandation, the corressponding inbound and outbound must enable TLS to use this transport.

## HttpObject

`DomainSocketObject` is used in `httpSettings` field in `TransportObject` and `StreamSettingsObject`.

```javascript
{
  "host": ["v2ray.com"],
  "path": "/random/path"
}
```

> `host`: \[ string \]

A string array. Each element is a domain. Client picks up a domain at random for each request. Server checks whether the domain in incoming request is in the list.

> `path`: string

HTTP path. Client and server must have the same value.
