{% endhint %}

## Outbound configuration {#outbound}

```javascript

}
```

## Sample {#sample}

MTProto can only be used for Telegram traffic. You may need a routing rule to combine the corresponding inbound and outbound. Here is an incomplete sample.

Inbound:

```javascript
{
  "tag": "tg-in",
  "port": 443,
  "protocol": "mtproto",
  "settings": {
    "users": [{"secret": "b0cbcef5a486d9636472ac27f8e11a9d"}]
  }
}
```

Outbound:

```javascript
{
  "tag": "tg-out",
  "protocol": "mtproto",
  "settings": {}
}
```

Routing:

```javascript
{
  "type": "field",
  "inboundTag": ["tg-in"],
  "outboundTag": "tg-out"
}
```

The configure your Telegram app to connect to 443 port on this machine.
