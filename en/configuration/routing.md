# Routing

V2Ray has an internal routing mechanism. It routes inbound connections to various outbound based on rules. A common scenario is to split traffic by country. V2Ray can detect target country (by Geo IP) of a connection, and sends then connection to corresponding outbound proxy.

## RoutingObject

`RoutingObject` is used as `routing` in top level configuration.

```javascript
{
  "domainStrategy": "AsIs",
  "rules": [],
  "balancers": []
}
```

> `domainStrategy`: "AsIs" | "IPIfNonMatch" | "IPOnDemand"

Domain resolution strategy. Choices are:

* `"AsIs"`: Only use domain for routing. Default value.
* `"IPIfNonMatch"`: When no rule matches current domain, V2Ray resolves it into IP addresses (A or AAAA records) and try all rules again.
  * If a domain has multiple IP addresses, V2Ray tries all of them.
  * The resolved IPs are only used for routing decisions, the traffic is still sent to original domain address.
* `"IPOnDemand"`: As long as there is a IP-based rule, V2Ray resolves the domain into IP immediately.

> `rules`: \[[RuleObject](#ruleobject)\]

An array of rules. For each inbound connection, V2Ray tries these rules from top down one by one. If a rule takes effect, the connection will be routed to the `outboundTag` (or `balancerTag`, V2Ray 4.4+) of the rule.

> `balancers`: \[ [BalancerObject](#balancerobject) \]

(V2Ray 4.4+) An array of load balancers. When a routing rule points to a load balancer, the balancer will select an outbound based on configuration. Then traffic will be sent to that outbound.

### RuleObject

```javascript
{
  "type": "field",
  "domain": [
    "baidu.com",
    "qq.com",
    "geosite:cn"
  ],
  "ip": [
    "0.0.0.0/8",
    "10.0.0.0/8",
    "fc00::/7",
    "fe80::/10",
    "geoip:cn"
  ],
  "port": "53,443,1000-2000",
  "network": "tcp",
  "source": [
    "10.0.0.1"
  ],
  "user": [
    "love@v2ray.com"
  ],
  "inboundTag": [
    "tag-vmess"
  ],
  "protocol":["http", "tls", "bittorrent"],
  "attrs": "attrs[':method'] == 'GET'",
  "outboundTag": "direct",
  "balancerTag": "balancer"
}
```

{% hint style='info' %}

When multiple fields are specified, these fields have to be all satisfied, in order to make the rule effective. If you need both `domain` and `ip` rules, it is highly likely you need put them into separate rules.

{% endhint %}

> `type`: "field"

The only valid value for now is `"field"`.

> `domain`: \[ string \]

An array of domains. Available formats are:

* Plaintext: If this string matches any part of the targeting domain, this rule takes effet. Example: rule `"sina.com"` matches targeting domain `"sina.com"`, `"sina.com.cn"` and `"www.sina.com"`, but not `"sina.cn"`.
* Regular expression: Begining with `"regexp:"`, the rest is a regular expression. When the regexp matches targeting domain, this rule takes effect. Example: rule `"regexp:\\.goo.*\\.com$"` matches `"www.google.com"` and `"fonts.googleapis.com"`, but not `"google.com"`.
* Subdomain (recommended): Begining with `"domain:"` and the rest is a domain. When the targeting domain is exactly the value, or is a subdomain of the value, this rule takes effect. Example: rule `"domain:v2ray.com"` matches `"www.v2ray.com"`, `"v2ray.com"`, but not `"xv2ray.com"`.
* Full domain: Begining with `"full:"` and the rest is a domain. When the targeting domain is exactly the value, the rule takes effect. Example: rule `"domain:v2ray.com"` matches `"v2ray.com"`, but not `"www.v2ray.com"`.
* Pre-defined domain list: Begining with `"geosite:"` and the rest is a name, such as `geosite:google` or `geosite:cn`. See [Pre-defined domain list](#pre-defined-domain-lists) for more detail.
* Domains from file: Such as `"ext:file:tag"`. The value must begin with `ext:` (lowercase), and followed by filename and tag. The file is placed in [resource directory](env.md#location-of-v2ray-asset), and has the same format of `geosite.dat`. The tag must exist in the file.

> `ip`: \[string\]

An array of IP ranges. When the targeting IP is in one of the ranges, this rule takes effect. Available formats:

* IP: such as `"127.0.0.1"`.
* [CIDR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing): such as `"127.0.0.0/8"`.
* GeoIP: such as `"geoip:cn"`. It begins with `geoip:` (lower case) and followed by two letter of country code.
  * Special value `"geoip:private"`: for all private addresses such as `127.0.0.1`.
* IPs from file: Such as `"ext:file:tag"`. The value must begin with `ext:` (lowercase), and followed by filename and tag. The file is placed in [resource directory](env.md#location-of-v2ray-asset), and has the same format of `geoip.dat`. The tag must exist in the file.

{% hint style='info' %}

`"ext:geoip.dat:cn"` is equivalent to `"geoip:cn"`.

{% endhint %}

> `port`：number | string

Port range. Formats are:

* `"a-b"`: Both `a` and `b` are positive integers and less than 65536. When the targeting port is in [`a`, `b`), this rule takes effect.
* `a`: `a` is a positive integer, and less than 65536. When the targeting port is `a`, this rule takes effect.
* Mix of the two above, separated by ",". Such as `"53,443,1000-2000"`.

> `network`: "tcp" | "udp" | "tcp,udp"

When the connection has in the chosen network, this rule take effect.

> `source`: \[string\]

An array of IP ranges. Same format as `ip`. When the source IP of the connection is in the IP range, this rule takes effect.

> `user`: \[string\]

An array of email address. When the inbound connection uses an user account of the email address, this rule takes effect. For now  Shadowsocks and VMess support user with email.

> `inboundTag`: \[string\]

An array of string as inbound proxy tags. When the connection comes from one of the specified inbound proxy, this rule takes effect.

> `protocol`: \[ "http" | "tls" | "bittorrent" \]

An array of string as protocol types. When the connection uses one of the protocols, this rule takes effect. To recognize the protocol of a connection, one must enable `sniffing` option in inbound proxy.

> `attrs`: string

(V2Ray 4.18+) A Starlark script, used for detecting traffic attributes. When this script returns true, this rule takes effect.

[Starlark](https://github.com/bazelbuild/starlark) is a subset of Python. The script takes a global varible named `attrs`. It contains all attributes of the traffic.

At the moment, only http inbound sets `attrs`.

Examples:

* Detect HTTP GET: `"attrs[':method'] == 'GET'"`
* Detect HTTP Path: `"attrs[':path'].startswith('/test')"`
* Detect Content Type: `"attrs['accept'].index('text/html') >= 0"`

> `outboundTag` string

[Tag of the outbound](protocols.md) that the connection will be sent to, if this rule take effect.

> `balancerTag`: string

Tag of an load balancer. Then this rule takes effect, V2Ray will use the balancer to select an outbound. Either `outboundTag` or `balancerTag` must be specified. When both are specified, `outboundTag` takes priority.

### BalancerObject

Configuration for a load balancer. When a load balancer takes effective, it selects one outbound from matching outbounds. This outbound will be used for send out-going traffic.

```javascript
{
  "tag": "balancer",
  "selector": []
}
```

> `tag`: string

Tag of this `BalancerObject`, to be matched from `balancerTag` in `RuleObject`.

> `selector`: \[ string \]

An array of strings. These strings are used to select outbounds with prefix matching. For example, with the following outbound tags: `[ "a", "ab", "c", "ba" ]`，selector `["a"]` matches `[ "a", "ab" ]`.

When multiple outbounds are selected, load balancer for now picks one final outbound at random.

## Pre-defined domain lists

This is a domain lists maintained by [domain-list-community](https://github.com/v2ray/domain-list-community) project. It provides a file named `geosite.dat` for some predefined domain lists. Notably:

* `category-ads`: Common ads domains.
* `category-ads-all`: Common ads domains and ads providers' domains.
* `cn`: Equivalent to an union of `geolocation-cn` and `tld-cn`.
* `google`: All Google domains.
* `facebook`: All Facebook domains.
* `geolocation-cn`: Common domains that serve in China.
* `geolocation-!cn`: Common domains that don't serve in China
* `speedtest`: All domains used by Speedtest.
* `tld-cn`: All .cn and .中国 domains.
